# Leaf Insight: Disease Detection & Age Estimation

This project is a deep learning-based system that analyzes leaf images to detect diseases and estimate leaf age. It is built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and trained on the PlantVillage dataset.

## Features

- **Disease Detection**: Classifies whether the leaf is healthy or diseased.
- **Age Estimation**: Predicts the approximate age of a leaf in days.


## Dataset

### PlantVillage Dataset (from Kaggle)

- **Link**: [PlantVillage Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/emmarex/plantdisease) 
- **Classes Used**:
  - **Potato**: Healthy, Late Blight, Early Blight
  - **Pepper**: Healthy, Bacterial Spot
  - **Tomato**: Healthy, Target Spot, Bacterial Spot, Early Blight, Late Blight, Leaf Mold, Spider Mites


## Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **TensorFlow / Keras**
- **OpenCV** (for preprocessing)
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** (for visualization)
- **scikit-learn** (for evaluation)
- **NumPy / Pandas**
